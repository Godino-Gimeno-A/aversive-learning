Short-term memory test scripts files:
  av_check --> was used in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'check'
  av_grey --> was used in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'grey'
Long-term memory test scripts files:
  training_check --> used during the training phase (4 days) in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'check'
  probe24h_check --> apply at the probe phase, 24 hours after the training period, in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'check'
  training_grey --> used during the training phase (4 days) in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'grey'
  probe24h_grey --> apply at the probe phase, 24 hours after the training period, in units where the fish conditioning pattern was 'grey'
